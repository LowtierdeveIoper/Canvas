# FYGG (F*** You GoGuardian)

## Info
Hello! Welcome to the repo for FYGG. Thanks for visiting!

FYGG is a launcher for a proxy that allows you to do things such as browse the web freely and privately, play games, and use apps such as Discord or Twitter.

With the method I used in this repo, you can open the proxy and is unable to be seen by GoGuardian.

Although the proxy itself is invisible to GoGuardian, the launcher is not. Beware of opening the launcher when GoGuardian is in use.

## Support / Contact

To contact me for support, questions, or anything of the sorts, join the Discord server and DM me or ask in the support channel.

## Online Usage

Although it may seem obvious, some people could not figure it out. To use the proxy, open up [the website](https://lowtierdeveloper.github.io/FYGG) and click ``Open FYGG``.

## Local Installation

### Step 1.

Click the green ``Code`` button in the top right, and click ``Download ZIP``.

### Step 2.

Open up the ZIP file you just downloaded, and open the ``index.html`` file in your browser.

Double-clicking the file should open it in your default browser.


## To-Do

* ~~Add a login page for further safety.~~ Scrapped, used for a seperate private version of FYGG.
* Fix the proxy browser from not working in certain conditions.
* Find a workaround for most of the non-flash games being blocked.
